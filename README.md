# Password Cracker

## Overview
This project is a basic **Password Cracker** built in Python. It attempts to recover plaintext passwords from hashed versions using either **brute-force attacks** or **dictionary attacks**. The tool supports common hashing algorithms such as **MD5**, **SHA-1**, and **SHA-256**.

## Features
- Hashing algorithms: MD5, SHA-1, SHA-256.
- Brute-force attack: Generates all possible password combinations.
- Dictionary attack: Tries to match the hash with words from a given dictionary file.
- Simple command-line interface for ease of use.

## How to Run
